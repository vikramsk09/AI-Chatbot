# AI-Chatbot
This project is a console-based AI Chatbot built using Python that interacts with users through text and responds using both text and voice output. The chatbot, named Oliver, uses the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech functionality, enabling it to speak responses like a virtual assistant.
