# AI Chatbot
This project is a console-based AI Chatbot built using Python that interacts with users through text and responds using both text and voice output. The chatbot, named Oliver, uses the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech functionality, enabling it to speak responses like a virtual assistant.

🚀 Features

Interactive conversational chatbot

Voice response using Text-to-Speech (TTS)

Dynamic time retrieval using datetime module

Basic arithmetic calculation handling

Continuous chat loop until user exits

Exception handling for invalid inputs

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech Engine)

datetime module

📌 How It Works

The chatbot processes user input through conditional logic and matches keywords to predefined responses. For calculation requests, it evaluates mathematical expressions dynamically. All responses are printed to the console and spoken aloud using the speech engine.

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Implemented real-time user interaction

Integrated external Python libraries

Practiced conditional logic and control flow

Built a basic foundation for voice-enabled AI systems
